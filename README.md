<br/>

A decentralised social media platform where users can post stuff while preserving their privacy and anonymity. People can tip posts based on whether they like it or not. The posts appear based on the highest number of tips first. So, the system guarantees that the best content will be shown first and probably get tipped more.

The application is built using the ethereum blockchain.
